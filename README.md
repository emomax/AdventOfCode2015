# AdventOfCode2015
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2015 (adventofcode.com) written in Ruby.

Each day is divided into two tasks. The instructions are included in the beginning of each .rb-file and the input is in the input.txt-file in each task-directory. 

If you think I have solved the problems in an ugly or weird way, don't hesitate to tell me! I'm always eager to learn more.
